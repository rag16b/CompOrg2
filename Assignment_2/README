	The c file I have provided as part of my submission for this project can handle
everything up to, and including, forwarding (if using the grade breakdown in the project
2 pdf). My program is in no way able to handle branching (neither by assuming a branch is
not taken and correcting later, nor using prediction). My program seemingly handles all
instructions properly (even when forwarding), with the exception of bne since it won't
actually branch when it needs to.
	Apart from the above information, there are no issues within my program to the
best of my knowledge.



Test Suite Breakdown:

	-branch.asm was created to test for regular branch instructions that would skip
	ahead in the program

	-forwarding.asm was created to thoroughly test forwarding with all different types
	of instructions

	-instructionFill.asm was created to test whether my program could handle fully
	populating the data memory and completely filling all the 't' and 's' registers
	(for some reason testGen seems to not properly translate at least one of the 'v'
	registers).

	-limitAndTryAll.asm was created to test the instruction limit (100) and try at
	least one of every instruction.

	-loop.asm was created to test for a branch instruction that would cause a loop

	-loopBreak.asm was created to test for a branch instruction that would break out
	of a loop created by a different branch instruction.
