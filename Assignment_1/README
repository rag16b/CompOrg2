# Project 1 - MIPS Assembler
# CDA 3101: Spring 2019

	The provided c program file appears to be able to handle all instructions required
by the professor. Note that their were some errors with the provided executable which forced
me to manually test the instructions: bne, nor, la. Neither bne or nor were handled in the
provided executable and the handling of la appeared to be incorrect. Similarly, it seems that
in certain cases negative numbers are handled incorrectly by the provided executable and had to
be tested manually.

# Unresolved issues
	Although my program can handle branch instructions generally speaking, it looks like it
is unable to handle branch backward instructions.

# Specific (semmingly resolved) issues
	# Ori
	When implementing ori, I was using sscanf to pull information from strings and in certain
cases this resulted in a segmentation fault. I fixed the issue by changing the way in which sscanf
was pulling the information (although the change I made shouldn't have affected the way it
functioned). Further detail on what exactly I changed was given within my source code. (I assume their
actually is a difference, only I don't have a good enough understanding of how sscanf works to know.
