// Ryan Gutierrez
// Project 3 - Cache Simulator
// CDA 3101: Spring 2019

	As far as I know have successfully implemented all the requirements
for the project in my program. The only known issue I found was that when
comparing the output of my program vs the provided executable (ONLY when
running it with my maxNumRef test file) I had one more Memory Reference in
the Write-back with Write Allocate cache.

Test Suite Breakdown:

-allReads was a test case I made to test a case in which my program only
encountered reads.

-allWrites is the same thing as allReads but instead of reads it has writes

-directMapped was created to test a scenario with a direct mapped cache

-fullyAssociative was created to test a fully associative cache. This
actually helped me solve an issue I was unaware of: my index was being
calculated incorrectly in this scenario.

-maxNumRef was created to test a case with the maximum number of references
which was 100

-randTest was created as an extra test with no explicit purpose

***Note that throughout all of the test cases I tested various block sizes,
   number of sets, and associativities.
